# MERN-ecommerce
Modern consumers expect fast, seamless, visually appealing online shopping experiences. Traditional retail websites often lack responsiveness, dynamic UI, efficient search, or powerful admin tools for product management.
The challenge is to design and develop a full-stack E-Commerce Web Application with a clean dark interface, secure authentication, product browsing, cart management, and a lightweight admin panel that allows basic product control.
The system must be built using a strict MERN tech stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, React, TailwindCSS) and include a REST API architecture. The web application should be optimized for speed, usability, and maintainability while delivering a modern shopping experience.
The website must allow users to browse products, view details, manage a cart, authenticate securely, and perform a dummy checkout. Admin users must be able to add, edit, and delete products efficiently.
